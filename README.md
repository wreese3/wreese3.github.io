# William Reese's Landing Page

> Make your own landing page with your own content, and design.

## What Is This? 
My DIY Landing Page with these features. 

* My content. My design.
* Customizable and persistent URLs
* Portable. Take it to any web host. 
* Future proof, and easy to maintain. You own the code via GitHub
* Secure, and scalable to many CDNs worldwide via Netlify, Vercel, etc.

This landing page was used using a pre-existing theme, but the content was customized and made my own. I've used javascript to dynamically allow myself to add links as I like.

## Why Does This Exist? 
Many services offer a single-page-landing. These "web portals" have existed for decades before [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/), [About.Me](https://about.me), [Card](https://carrd.co/), etc.

There are too many services to choose from. Each one has minor differences, and benefits with premium paid upgrades.
